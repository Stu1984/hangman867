# Hangman AI Core Project
Hangman is a classic game. In this project, we will be creating a veriosn of Hangman where the player plays against the computer. All code will be written in Python to be played in the Terminal.

To play the game, call the ask_for_input() funtion. 

The game will then ask you to enter a single letter and will tell you if the letter is in the word or not.
