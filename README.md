# Hangman AI Core Project
Hangman is a classic game. In this project, we will be creating a veriosn of Hangman where the player plays against the computer. All code will be written in Python to be played in the Terminal.

To play the game, call the ask_for_input() funtion. 

The game will then ask you to enter a single letter and will tell you if the letter is in the word or not. The game will print a list with underscores representing the letters still to be guessed and the letters completed for the guesses you have made correctly.

For example, if the word is 'apple' and your first guess was 'p' you will see ['_','p','p','_','_'] in the terminal.

You will start the game with 5 lives, each wrong guess reduces your lives by one.

Another list will be printed to the terminal that shows you the letters you have guessed so far.
